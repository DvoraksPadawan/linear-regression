# linear-regression

My implementation of linear regression machine learning algorithm for predicting commodity prices. This algorithm leverages gradient descent on training data to make accurate price predictions. I utilized essential tools such as NumPy, Jupyter, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib to drive data analysis and visualization.
